As means of a brief introduction, my name is Jim Hull. I animated for Disney and Dreamworks for over 20 years. In 2016, I left the animation industry as a worker-bee to start my own story development platform, [Subtext](https://narrativefirst.com/subtext), based on my years of experience consulting for my company [Narrative First](https://narrativefirst.com).

I _love_ developing applications (almost more so than traditional 2D-animation), with my favorite part being the opportunity to wake up every morning and begin anew (thus, _constantRefresh_).

My intention for this blog is to give an idea of my thinking behind the apps I build, as well as hopefully helping others avoid the headaches and hassles I've encountered along the way.
